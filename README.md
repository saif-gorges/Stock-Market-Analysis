#VBA CHALLENGE

##About this project

The purpose of this project was to develop VBA script to parse through stock data and output stock analytics.

The script will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

-The ticker symbol.

-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  -It also has conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

-The total stock volume of the stock.

-The script will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

-Analysis Result

-After running the script on the Workbook, the result should look as follows:
